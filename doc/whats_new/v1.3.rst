Version 1.3.0
=============

**In Development**

.. include:: changelog_legend.inc

Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

- |Fix| The `categories_` attribute of :class:`preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` now
  always contains an array of `object`s when using predefined categories that
  are strings. Predefined categories encoded as bytes will no longer work
  with `X` encoded as strings. :pr:`25174` by :user:`Tim Head <betatim>`.

Changes impacting all modules
-----------------------------

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

:mod:`sklearn.ensemble`
.......................
- |Feature| Compute a custom out-of-bag score by passing a callable to
  :class:`ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`, :class:`ensemble.RandomForestRegressor`,
  :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier` and :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor`.
  :pr:`25177` by :user:`Tim Head <betatim>`.

:mod:`sklearn.pipeline`
.......................
- |Feature| :class:`pipeline.FeatureUnion` can now use indexing notation (e.g.
  `feature_union["scalar"]`) to access transformers by name. :pr:`25093` by
  `Thomas Fan`_.

:mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`
............................
- |Enhancement| Added support for `sample_weight` in
  :class:`preprocessing.KBinsDiscretizer`. This allows specifying the parameter
  `sample_weight` for each sample to be used while fitting. The option is only
  available when `strategy` is set to `quantile`.
  :pr:`24935` by :user:`Seladus <seladus>`, :user:`Guillaume Lemaitre <glemaitre>`, and
  :user:`Dea María Léon <deamarialeon>`.
